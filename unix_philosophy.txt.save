<p><b>The Unix Philosophy</b></p>
<p>From <i>The Unix Programming Environment</i> &#40;1984&#41; by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike</p>
<br>
<p>Even though the Unix system introduces a number of innovative programs and techniques, no single progran or idea makes it work well.
 Instead, what makes it effective is the approach to programming, a philosophy of using the computer. Although that philosophy can&#39t be written down in a single sentence, at its heart is the idea that the power of a system comes more from the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves.
Many UNIX programs do quite trivial things in isolation, but, combined with other programs, become general and useful tools.
